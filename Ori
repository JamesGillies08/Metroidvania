Hollow knight is a very good game. The team who made are even cooler they are called team cherry. ori and the will of the wisps is a almost near perfect sequal.
I myself have got to 100% completion for Ori and the will of the wisps and hollow knight to 112%. 
The Dlc of Hollow knight is especially hard as NKG and The Pantheon of Hollow nest Excist.
